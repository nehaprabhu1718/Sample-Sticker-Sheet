# Sample-Sticker-Sheet
Creates a sticker sheet using C++ language, and a given png 

My goal in this project was to make a StickerSheet composed of a collection of Images. To do so, I used a class StickerSheet that maintains an array of pointers to Image objects. Each Image in the Scene has an index, an x-coordinate, and a y-coordinate. The member functions described below support creation, modification, and drawing of the collection of Image stickers in the StickerSheet. 

To implement the StickerSheet class, I wrote a header file that contains a declaration of the StickerSheet class (StickerSheet.h) and a source file that contains the implementation of the StickerSheet class (StickerSheet.cpp)
